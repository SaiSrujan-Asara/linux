What is a Package Manager?

📘 1. What Is a Package?

Before we understand a package manager, we need to understand what a package is.

🔹 A package is:

A compressed file containing:

1) Application binaries

2) Metadata (version, dependencies, description, maintainer, etc.)

3) Optional: Scripts to install, uninstall, configure

Think of it as an "app bundle" that can be installed on your system.

Example:

htop_3.0.5-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

htop: package name

3.0.5-1ubuntu1: version

amd64: architecture (64-bit)

What Is a Package Manager?

A package manager is a tool or system that:

| Function   | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 📥 Install | Installs software and all its dependencies        |
| 🔁 Update  | Keeps software up to date                         |
| ❌ Remove   | Removes installed software                        |
| 🔍 Search  | Finds packages by name or description             |
| 🧾 Info    | Shows version, size, dependencies, etc.           |
| 🔐 Verify  | Checks integrity, GPG signatures                  |
| 🧠 Resolve | Automatically manages dependencies                |
| 🤝 Track   | Keeps track of what’s installed and what’s needed |

🔄 Key Benefits:

Automation: Install with one command — no manual compilation

Version control: Choose specific versions

Security: Comes from trusted sources (signed packages)

Dependency resolution: Automatically installs what your software needs

🧱 3. How Does a Package Manager Work?

It typically follows this flow:

1) Fetch metadata from repositories (e.g. Ubuntu servers)

2) Download package and dependencies

3) Install all in the correct order

4) Log the installation

5) Track changes so you can later update/remove

What Is a Package Format?

A package format defines:

1) How the software is packaged (compressed, structured)

2) How it's installed/uninstalled

3) How dependencies are handled

Ubuntu supports multiple package formats, each with different use cases

The 3 Main Package Types in Ubuntu

| Package Type | Native to Ubuntu? | Uses                                      | Example                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `.deb`       | ✅ Yes             | Traditional Debian packages               | `nginx_1.14.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb`       |
| **Snap**     | ✅ Yes             | Containerized applications from Canonical | `snap install code`                     |
| **Flatpak**  | ❌ No (optional)   | Universal desktop apps                    | `flatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP` |


----------
🔸 1. .deb Packages (Debian Format)

Traditional package format for Ubuntu/Debian

Managed by: apt, dpkg

Stored in: .deb files

Comes from: Ubuntu official repos or PPAs

--
🔍 Anatomy of a .deb file:

control: Metadata (name, version, dependencies)

data.tar.gz: Actual files (binaries, configs)

postinst, prerm: Scripts to run after install/uninstall

--
🔧 Tools Used:

apt, apt-get, dpkg, debuild, lintian
