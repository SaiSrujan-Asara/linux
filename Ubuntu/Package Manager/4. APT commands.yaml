2. Explanation & Use Cases

----------------------------

apt full-upgrade

Unlike apt upgrade, it allows removal of conflicting packages.

Useful during major upgrades or kernel updates.

----

apt install --reinstall

Fix broken packages by reinstalling them.

Useful when config files or binaries get corrupted.

----

apt-mark hold / unhold

Hold packages to prevent unwanted upgrades.

Common when you want to freeze a specific version for stability.

----

apt-cache depends & rdepends

Investigate package dependency chains.

Helps in understanding why packages are installed.

----

apt policy

Shows where a package is installed from and its versions.

Helpful for debugging version conflicts.

----

apt edit-sources

Opens /etc/apt/sources.list for editing.

Useful for adding/removing repositories.

-----------------------------------
⚠️ 4. Best Practices & Tips
---------------------------------

Use apt-mark hold carefully; held packages won’t receive updates.

Always check dependencies with apt-cache depends before removing packages.

Use apt policy to diagnose why a certain version is installed.

Prefer full-upgrade over upgrade when performing system-wide updates.

Backup sources list before editing (/etc/apt/sources.list).
