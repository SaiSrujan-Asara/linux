📌 What is a Repository?

A repository is a collection of packages stored on remote servers. Ubuntu pulls software from these when using apt.

🧱 Types of Ubuntu Repositories (by Support Level)

Ubuntu repositories are grouped into 4 main components based on:

1) Licensing

2) Support by Canonical

3) Source or third-party contributions

| Component    | Description                                    | Officially Supported? | Contains Proprietary? |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `main`       | Official Ubuntu packages                       | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                  |
| `restricted` | Supported but proprietary (e.g., drivers)      | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                 |
| `universe`   | Community-maintained open-source packages      | ❌ No                  | ❌ No                  |
| `multiverse` | Non-free software (legal/ethical restrictions) | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes                 |

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535

🔙 How to Remove a PPA
