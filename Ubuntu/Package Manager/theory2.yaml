APT Basics – apt vs apt-get vs apt-cache and Core Commands

📦 1. What is APT?

APT stands for Advanced Package Tool — it’s the main system for:

1) Installing

2) Updating

3) Removing

4) Managing packages on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu)

APT is a high-level interface that internally uses lower-level tools like:

1) dpkg (actual package installation)

2) apt-get, apt-cache (older, still useful)
