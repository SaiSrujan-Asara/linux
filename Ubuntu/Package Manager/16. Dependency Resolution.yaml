🧠 What Are Package Dependencies?

A dependency is another package that a package needs to function properly.

Example: Installing vlc requires libraries like libqt5gui, libvlccore, etc.

🔧 Types of Dependencies in Debian/Ubuntu

| Type           | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Depends**    | Must be installed for the package to work       |
| **Recommends** | Strongly suggested, but optional                |
| **Suggests**   | Related packages, completely optional           |
| **Conflicts**  | Package that cannot be installed together       |
| **Breaks**     | Will break the functionality of another package |

🧪 Example: View Package Dependencies

apt-cache depends vlc

Output example:

vlc
 |Depends: vlc-bin
 |Depends: vlc-plugin-base
 |Recommends: vlc-plugin-video-output
 |Suggests: mozilla-plugin-vlc


You can also view reverse dependencies:

apt-cache rdepends vlc

------
🔧 Recursive Dependency Tree

To see all nested dependencies, use:

apt-rdepends vlc

📦 This will show you a full tree of what vlc depends on and what those packages depend on.

If apt-rdepends isn't installed:

sudo apt install apt-rdepends

-------
🛠️ Fixing Broken Dependencies

Common fixes:

Fix all broken dependencies:

sudo apt -f install

Configure unpacked packages:

sudo dpkg --configure -a

Remove conflicting packages manually:

sudo apt remove <conflicting-package>

🧼 Best Practices

| Practice                                              | Why                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Prefer `apt` over `dpkg` for installs                 | Automatically resolves dependencies         |
| Check with `apt-cache depends` before manual installs | Avoid missing packages                      |
| Use `apt-rdepends` to explore full dependency trees   | Great for debugging or understanding impact |
| Regularly update and clean dependencies               | Use `apt autoremove`                        |
| Watch for conflicts and breaks                        | Important during upgrades                   |

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| List dependencies              | `apt-cache depends <pkg>`  |
| List reverse dependencies      | `apt-cache rdepends <pkg>` |
| Full recursive dependency tree | `apt-rdepends <pkg>`       |
| Fix broken installs            | `sudo apt -f install`      |
| Configure packages             | `sudo dpkg --configure -a` |
