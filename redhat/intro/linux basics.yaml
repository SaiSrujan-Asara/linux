🔵 What is Linux?

(Beginner → Advanced → Deep Internals → RHCSA-level understanding)

✅ 1. Definition — What Exactly Is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

When combined with additional software (GNU tools, system utilities, libraries), it becomes a full operating system commonly referred to as:

GNU/Linux

Linux OS

Linux Distribution (Distro)

--
Examples:

RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) — enterprise use

CentOS Stream

Fedora

Ubuntu

Debian

SUSE / openSUSE

✔️ Linux is free
✔️ Open-source
✔️ Secure
✔️ Highly customizable
✔️ Used in servers, cloud, DevOps, cybersecurity, embedded systems

---
✅ 2. Linux Architecture (Complete Explanation)

Linux consists of these major components:

2.1 Kernel (Core of Linux)

The kernel manages:

Memory

CPU scheduling

Disk I/O

Hardware drivers

System calls

Processes

This is the heart of Linux.

---
Types of Linux kernels

Monolithic kernel (Linux uses this)

Microkernel

Hybrid kernel

Why monolithic?

Because the entire OS services (device drivers, scheduling, memory) run in kernel space → faster but larger.

--
2.2 Shell

The shell is a command interpreter that sits between the user and the kernel.

Common shells:

bash (default in most distros)

sh

zsh

fish

ksh

💡 When you type a command (like ls), the shell interprets it → kernel executes it → output displayed.

--
2.3 GNU Tools

GNU provides the basic user-space tools:

ls

cp

mv

rm

cat

grep

sed

awk

coreutils

Without these, Linux is just a kernel — not usable.

--
2.4 Filesystem Hierarchy (FHS)

Standard layout of files:

| Directory       | Purpose                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **/**           | Root directory             |
| **/etc**        | System configs             |
| **/var**        | Logs & variable data       |
| **/home**       | User home directories      |
| **/bin**, /sbin | Essential commands         |
| **/usr**        | Applications and utilities |
| **/boot**       | Kernel + GRUB              |
| **/dev**        | Device files               |
| **/proc**, /sys | Kernel info                |


--
2.5 Services and systemd

Linux services like network, SSH, firewall are managed by systemd.

Examples:

systemctl start sshd

systemctl status firewalld

✅ 3. What Makes Linux Different?
| Feature       | Linux              | Windows   |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Source Code   | Open               | Closed    |
| Cost          | Free               | Paid      |
| Customization | Very high          | Limited   |
| Security      | Very high          | Moderate  |
| Servers       | Dominant (90%+)    | Low       |
| CLI usage     | Heavy              | Optional  |
| Updates       | Controlled by user | Automatic |

✅ 4. Types of Linux Distributions

4.1 Enterprise Distros

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

Used in:

Corporates

Banks

Datacenters

---
4.2 Community Distros

Fedora (upstream for RHEL)

CentOS Stream

Debian

Ubuntu

---
4.3 Security Distros

Kali Linux

Parrot OS

---
4.4 Lightweight Distros

Alpine

Puppy Linux

---
✅ 5. Where Is Linux Used? (Real World Examples)

5.1 Servers (Major Use Case)

Web servers, database servers, DNS servers, cloud servers.

5.2 Cloud Platforms

AWS, Azure, GCP all use Linux for:

VMs

Containers

Kubernetes nodes

5.3 DevOps

Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD all depend on Linux.

5.4 Networking

Firewalls, routers, load balancers use Linux.

5.5 Embedded Systems

Android phones, TVs, smart watches → run Linux kernel.

5.6 Supercomputers

100% of the top 500 supercomputers use Linux.

---
✅ 6. Why Linux Is Important for Red Hat System Admin Certification

For RHCSA & RHCE, Linux is required because:

RHEL servers power corporate environments.

System admins must know CLI deeply.

Red Hat uses Linux heavily for automation, Ansible, virtualization and containers.

You will be tested on:

Command line usage

SELinux

Firewalld

LVM

Networking

systemd services

Boot process

User management

Filesystems

✅ 7. Advantages of Linux
✔️ Stability

Used in servers with years of uptime.

✔️ Security

Built-in permissions, SELinux, firewall.

✔️ Performance

Handles large workloads, high concurrency.

✔️ Open source

Modify anything.

✔️ Community support

Huge number of tutorials, fixes, patches.

---

✅ 8. Where Linux Should NOT Be Used

Heavy gaming (Windows better)

Advanced graphical applications like Adobe Photoshop (though alternatives exist)

Corporate environments that require Windows-only applications

Desktop users who hate command line

🟥 1. What is a Linux Distro? (Full Explanation)

A Linux distribution (distro) is:

A complete operating system built from the Linux kernel + GNU tools + system utilities + package manager + default configurations.

Linux itself is only a kernel, not an OS.

Distros package everything into a usable system.

Components included in a distro:

Linux kernel

GNU utilities

Package manager (like DNF, APT, Zypper)

Installer

Desktop environment (optional)

System services

Repositories and software

---
Why so many distros exist?

Because:

Linux is open-source

Anyone can build a custom operating system based on it

Different use-cases require different design philosophies

---
🟥 2. Types of Linux Distros (Categories)

2.1 Enterprise / Commercial Distros

Used in companies, banking, cloud, government:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

Oracle Linux (OL)

✔ Stable
✔ Long-term support (10+ years)
✔ Paid support
✔ Security updates
✔ Certification (RHCSA, RHCE, etc.)

---

2.2 Community Distros

Free and open-source, community driven:

Fedora

CentOS Stream

Debian

Ubuntu

✔ Free
✔ Latest technology
✔ Large community

---

2.3 Security Distros

Used for ethical hacking & cybersecurity:

Kali Linux

Parrot OS

---

2.4 Lightweight Distros

Used for old hardware or containers:

Alpine Linux

Arch Linux

Puppy Linux

---
🟥 3. Red Hat Distro Family (Very Important for RHCSA)

Red Hat maintains a 3-layer release model:

🟩 FEDORA → CENTOS STREAM → RHEL

Let’s break this down:

---

🔵 3.1 Fedora — Upstream Source for RHEL

Fedora = bleeding-edge testing ground.

✔ New features
✔ New kernel versions
✔ New software
✔ Fast release cycle (6 months)
✔ Developers & researchers use it

Red Hat takes stable features from Fedora → integrates them into CentOS Stream → final release becomes RHEL.

---

🔵 3.2 CentOS Stream — Midstream (Between Fedora and RHEL)

CentOS Stream is:

A continuously delivered preview of the next RHEL minor release.

✔ Rolling updates
✔ Used by developers building apps for RHEL
✔ Close to RHEL but not identical
✔ No paid support

Example:

If current RHEL version = 9.4
CentOS Stream reflects = 9.5 development branch

---

🔵 3.3 RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) — Downstream, Enterprise Release

RHEL is:

✔ Most stable
✔ Highly tested
✔ Corporate support
✔ Long-term lifecycle (10+ years)
✔ Used in enterprises, cloud, banking

It is a downstream distro — meaning all features come from Fedora → CentOS Stream → polished into RHEL.

---

🟥 4. RHEL Clones (Rebuild / Downstream Distros)

These distros rebuild RHEL source code (open-source requirement) and provide free, RHEL-compatible OS.

Why clones exist?

Because Red Hat must publish source code (GPL license).
Other companies take that source → recompile → remove Red Hat branding → release as free OS.

The most popular RHEL clones:

---

🔶 4.1 Rocky Linux

Created by Gregory Kurtzer, original founder of CentOS.
Goal: 100% bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL.

✔ Enterprise stable
✔ Free
✔ Long-term support
✔ Very popular after CentOS 8 EOL

---

🔶 4.2 AlmaLinux

Created by CloudLinux.

✔ RHEL-compatible
✔ Free
✔ Community and corporate backed
✔ Lots of cloud availability

---

🔶 4.3 Oracle Linux (OL)

Oracle’s rebuild of RHEL.

✔ Free to use
✔ Oracle provides premium support (paid)
✔ Has UEK (Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel)
✔ Used for Oracle DB workloads

---

🔶 4.4 EuroLinux, Springdale Linux, Navy Linux

Less common but RHEL rebuilds as well.

| Kernel        | RHEL kernel                   | RHEL kernel  | RHEL + optional UEK |
| Certification | RHCSA/RHCE only valid on RHEL | ✖            | ✖                   |
